# TCP Server

This is a simple TCP server application written in C++.

## Description

The TCP server listens for incoming connections from clients and echoes back any received messages.

## Usage

To build the project, you can use your preferred build system or IDE. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including a C++ compiler.

Once the server is built, you can run it by executing the generated executable. By default, the server listens on IP address "127.0.0.1" and port number 54010.

To connect to the server, you can use a TCP client such as telnet or netcat.
